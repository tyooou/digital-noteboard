### Background:
One of the things I have noticed is the immense amount of digital tools available online. However, a common theme among these tools is that they are often overcluttered with non-essential features (which serve as distractions), and differ far too much too the non-digital tools. Thus, as my first Javascript project, I built <code>digital noteboard</code> with the same features you would find in a regular noteboard (e.g. write, draw, pin, remove), nothing more, nothing less. This preserves the focus of <code>digital noteboard</code> as a note-taking application, rather than a distraction.
